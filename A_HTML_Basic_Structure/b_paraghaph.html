    <p>In a quiet village surrounded by hills, a small cracked mirror hung inside an old house. Everyone avoided it because it showed not just reflections, but fears. One day, a curious child stood before it and saw trembling doubt in their own eyes. Instead of running away, the child smiled and whispered, “I am braver than you.” The reflection slowly changed, showing courage instead of fear, and from that day on, the mirror never frightened anyone again.</p>
